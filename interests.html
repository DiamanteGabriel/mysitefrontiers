          <h1>My Interests</h1>
          <h2>School Interests</h2>
          <p> I am currently in High School going into my Junior Year. My main
            subjects that I enjoy are computer Science and math classes. These
            are the classes that I pursue the most and have the most of in my
            school schedule. I am a hard worker in the classes that I enjoy and
            I maintain a 99 average in honors classes. </p>
          <br>
          <p> Next year I am going to be taking multiple AP classes to further
            pursue my knowledge mainly in the subjects that I enjoy the most.
            These classes are,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>AP Computer Science Principles</li>
            <li>AP Language and Composition</li>
            <li>AP Pre-Calculus</li>
            <li>AP Statistics</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I am excited to continue to pursue my interests when it comes to
            academics. </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Sports</h2>
          <p>I participate in multiple different sports at my school with all of
            them centered around running. I have been doing these sports for
            many years and serve a key spot on my teams for my school</p>
          <h4>Cross Country</h4>
          <p>This is the sport I participate in during the fall season. I am a
            part of my teams top 5 runners which score at events based on their
            place. I run a 5k race for each of my meets and typically maintain a
            just below 6 minute pace. I have gone to state competitions for
            cross country and have gotten to the regional round of the Junior
            Olympics.</p>
          <h4>Track</h4>
          <p>This is the sport I participate in during the winter, spring, and
            summer. I am a distance runner for my high school and mainly focus
            on the 1600 and 3200 as well as the 800 and 1000. I have state
            qualified in the 3200 multiple times and I have gone to the National
            Junior Olympics to compete in the 3000. Track is my favorite sport
            and one of my key interests that I have.</p>
