          <h1>My Town</h1>
          <p>I am from a small town in Connecticut called Prospect. It is a
            pretty small suburban town with just around a population of 10,000
            people. It was one of the newest towns created in Connecticut mainly
            because it was on a hill and there was no water there unless you dug
            deep into the ground using wells. It used to be considered the
            highest town in Connecticut based on elevation but that was later
            debunked. It is a very quiet small town where not much happens. We
            have a mayor who has been mayor since 1977 making him one of the
            longest serving mayors in the whole country. Nothing much happens in
            this town but we have a town Facebook page where people act like it
            is their own personal page and not one shared by the whole town.</p>
